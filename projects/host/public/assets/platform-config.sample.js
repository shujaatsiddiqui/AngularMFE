/**
 * This is a config object for setting up a remote module/component in a micro-frontend (MFE) setup.
 * Basically, it lets your host app load and use a module or component from another remote MFE app.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} PlatformConfig
 *
 * @property {Object} identifier - A unique key for the remote module/component you're bringing in.
 *    This is the "ID" that helps the app figure out where the remote module lives and how to load it.
 *
 * @property {string} identifier.path - The route or path in your host app where the module/component will appear.
 *    Think of this as the "URL" or "route" where the component will be accessed.
 *
 * @property {string} identifier.remoteEntry - The URL to the `remoteEntry.js` file from the remote MFE app.
 *    This is the entry point the host app uses to load the remote app's code and metadata.
 *
 * @property {string} identifier.remoteName - The name of the remote MFE app that you're loading the module from.
 *    It's like the ID for the remote app in the Webpack Module Federation setup.
 *
 * @property {string} identifier.exposedModule - The specific module or file being shared from the remote app.
 *    This points to the exact component or module you want to use in your host app (e.g., a React component or Angular module).
 *
 * @property {string} identifier.exposedModuleName - The name the remote module (e.g if exposedModule is "./TodoModule", then exposedModuleName is "TodoModule").
 *    This is how your host app will import and use the module.
